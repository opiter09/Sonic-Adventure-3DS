# Sonic Adventure for 3DS
Hey, forker here, all I did was remove all the hardcoded file paths so you can build this wherever. Admittedly, it will re-hardcode once you run it the first time, but just don't move it and you'll be fine.
Oh also, if you didn't know this needs devkitPro (and, as far as I can tell, only that) in order to be compiled: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started

# Original Readme
A port of the Dreamcast/Gamecube game by the same name. Heaviliy work-in-progress.
